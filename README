Made this one with Benjamin Gleitzman in his awesome class at NextStepTech.
Check his stuff out at github.com/Gleitz ...

run the analyze_sentiment procedure and input a string of text, get a score
associated with that text, outputs a phrase determining how good/bad the
sentence is.

Current issues:

punctuation causes the program to skip the word, so for example:

'happy!' would output a score of 0, when it should be 3.
